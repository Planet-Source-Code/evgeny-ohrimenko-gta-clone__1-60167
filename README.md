### Description

This is a clone of Gta. I started working on it 1 year ago. I didn't comment it, but if anyone asks to do so, i will do it with pleasure. Soon i will make much better city and much better collision detection system. The controls are w,a,s,d for your car and up,down,left,right for other car, v to change view, hold p to disable collision.

Rotation of wheels is coming....after you vote.

Please comment, vote and ask.
